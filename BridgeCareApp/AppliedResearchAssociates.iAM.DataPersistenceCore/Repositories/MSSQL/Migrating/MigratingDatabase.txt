in PowerShell. The "xxxxxxxx" is the migration name. You need to pick a fresh one every time.

PS C:\Code\Infrastructure Asset Management\BridgeCareApp\AppliedResearchAssociates.iAM.DataPersistenceCore> 
dotnet ef migrations add xxxxxxxxx -c IAMContext -o Migrations

Then . . .

PS C:\Code\Infrastructure Asset Management\BridgeCareApp\AppliedResearchAssociates.iAM.DataPersistenceCore> 
dotnet ef database update -c IAMContext

The first of the above commands gives a bunch of warnings (in yellow text) in the Powershell window.
