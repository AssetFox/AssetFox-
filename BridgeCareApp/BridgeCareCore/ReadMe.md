# BridgeCareCore

This is the backend for a corresponding Vue frontend located in "/BridgeCareApp/VuejsApp".
To run the app, start the backend, go to a command prompt in the frontend project folder, and then do this:

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run serve`

If there are no errors, you should see a URL in the command prompt for the frontend.
Go to that URL, and you are in the app.
